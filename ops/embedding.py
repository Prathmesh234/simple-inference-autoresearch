TokenEmbedding and OutputProjection.

What embeddings do
------------------
The model operates on continuous vectors, not integers. The embedding table
is a lookup: given a token ID, return the corresponding row of a learned
(vocab_size, hidden_size) weight matrix. That row is the token's initial
representation before any transformer layers run.

    token_id = 279   ("the")
    embedding = weight[279]   # shape: (hidden_size,)

For a sequence of T tokens you get shape (T, hidden_size), which becomes
the input to the first transformer block.

Tied embeddings
---------------
The output projection (the final step that converts hidden states back to
logit scores over the vocabulary) reuses the exact same weight matrix as
the input embedding. This is called weight tying.

    Input:  token_id → weight[token_id]            (lookup, shape: hidden_size)
    Output: hidden   → hidden @ weight.T            (matmul, shape: vocab_size)

Why tie them?
  - The embedding row for a token represents "what this token means as input"
  - The output projection row for a token represents "how likely is this token next"
  - Tying forces these two representations to live in the same space, which
    works well in practice and saves ~1.2 GB of parameters for this model
    (vocab_size × hidden_size × 2 bytes = 128256 × 4096 × 2 = 1050 MB × 2 without tying)

Shape contract
--------------
TokenEmbedding:
  input:  (batch, seq_len)          integer token IDs
  output: (batch, seq_len, hidden_size)

OutputProjection:
  input:  (batch, seq_len, hidden_size)
  output: (batch, seq_len, vocab_size)   these are raw logits, not probabilities
