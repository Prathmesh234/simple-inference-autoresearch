SwiGLU MLP — the feed-forward block inside every Llama transformer layer.

Why SwiGLU instead of a plain two-layer MLP?
----------------------------------------------
A standard two-layer MLP is:
    y = activation(x @ W_up.T) @ W_down.T

SwiGLU replaces that with a gated variant using THREE weight matrices:
    gate = silu(x @ W_gate.T)      # values in (0, 1) after sigmoid-weighted linear
    up   = x @ W_up.T              # unconstrained projection
    y    = (gate * up) @ W_down.T  # gate selects which up-projected values pass through

The intuition: the gate learns to suppress irrelevant features element-wise.
This "soft selection" is empirically stronger than plain GELU (no gating) and
comes at the cost of one extra matrix (W_gate) — a worthwhile trade-off for
model quality.

SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit):
    silu(x) = x * sigmoid(x)
    - Smooth, non-monotonic activation
    - Unlike ReLU it doesn't hard-zero negative values — gentler gradient flow
    - Used here because the sigmoid part forms the "gate"

Expand-then-contract pattern
------------------------------
    hidden_size      = 4096
    intermediate_size = 14336

    x        : (B, T, 4096)   ← input from residual stream
    gate, up : (B, T, 14336)  ← expand ~3.5×
    y        : (B, T, 4096)   ← contract back down

The expansion lets the model learn richer feature interactions before
contracting back to the residual stream dimension.

Weight shapes for Llama-3.1-8B
---------------------------------
    W_gate : (intermediate_size, hidden_size) = (14336, 4096)
    W_up   : (intermediate_size, hidden_size) = (14336, 4096)
    W_down : (hidden_size, intermediate_size) = (4096, 14336)

No biases — consistent with the rest of the Llama architecture.

MLP is usually the most compute-heavy op per layer (bigger matrices than attn)
and is COMPUTE-bound at prefill and MEMORY-bound at decode.

        Weight layout (Section 14b Level-2 fusion)
        ------------------------------------------
        W_gate and W_up share the same input x and produce parallel outputs of
        shape (B, T, I). We store them stacked as a single (2*I, H) parameter
        so the forward pass does ONE matmul instead of two:

            combined = x @ W_gate_up.T     # (B, T, 2I)
            gate, up = combined.chunk(2, dim=-1)

        This is the same trick vLLM calls MergedColumnParallelLinear.
        One larger GEMM beats two smaller GEMMs because of better tile
        utilization and a single set of kernel-launch / setup overheads.
